            <p>It'll be fine by dusk light, I'm tellin' you, baby
            These things eat at your bones and drive your young mind crazy
            But when you place your head between my collar and jaw
            I don't know much, but there's no weight at all
            
            And I'm damned if I do, and I'm damned if I don't
            'Cause if I say I miss you, I know that you won't
            But I miss you in the mornings when I see the sun
            Somethin' in the orange tells me we're not done</p>

            <p>To you, I'm just a man, to me, you're all I am
            Where the hell am I supposed to go?
            I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
            Tells me you're never comin' home
            
            If you leave today, I'll just stare at the way
            The orange touches all things around
            The grass, trees, and dew, how I just hate you
            Please turn those headlights around
            Please turn those headlights around</p>
        
            <p>I need to hear you say you've been waitin' all night
            There's orange dancin' in your eyes from bulb light
            Your voice only trembles when you try to speak
            Take me back to us dancin', this wood used to creak</p>

            <p>To you, I'm just a man, to me, you're all I am
            Where the hell am I supposed to go?
            I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
            Tells me you're never comin' home
            
            If you leave today, I'll just stare at the way
            The orange touches all things around
            The grass, trees, and dew, how I just hate you
            Please turn those headlights around</p>

            <p>To you, I'm just a man, to me, you're all I am
            Where the hell am I supposed to go?
            I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
            Tells me you're never comin' home
            
            If you leave today, I'll just stare at the way
            The orange touches all things around
            The grass, trees, and dew, how I just hate you
            Please turn those headlights around
            Please turn those headlights around</p>
