                <h2>Lyrics</h2>

                <p>It'll be fine by dusk light, I'm tellin' you, baby
                These things eat at your bones and drive your young mind crazy
                But when you place your head between my collar and jaw
                I don't know much, but there's no weight at all
                
                And I'm damned if I do, and I'm damned if I don't
                'Cause if I say I miss you, I know that you won't
                But I miss you in the mornings when I see the sun
                Somethin' in the orange tells me we're not done</p>

                <p>To you, I'm just a man, to me, you're all I am
                Where the hell am I supposed to go?
                I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
                Tells me you're never comin' home
                
                If you leave today, I'll just stare at the way
                The orange touches all things around
                The grass, trees, and dew, how I just hate you
                Please turn those headlights around
                Please turn those headlights around</p>
            
                <p>I need to hear you say you've been waitin' all night
                There's orange dancin' in your eyes from bulb light
                Your voice only trembles when you try to speak
                Take me back to us dancin', this wood used to creak</p>

                <p>To you, I'm just a man, to me, you're all I am
                Where the hell am I supposed to go?
                I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
                Tells me you're never comin' home
                
                If you leave today, I'll just stare at the way
                The orange touches all things around
                The grass, trees, and dew, how I just hate you
                Please turn those headlights around</p>

                <p>[Bridge]</p>

                <p>To you, I'm just a man, to me, you're all I am
                Where the hell am I supposed to go?
                I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
                Tells me you're never comin' home
                
                If you leave today, I'll just stare at the way

                <h2>About the Artist/Song</h2>

                <p>
                    At 26 years old, (Navy vet)Zack Bryan  released his breakthrough album 
                    American Heartbreak. It was certified gold in less than six months, 
                    debuing at No. 5 on the Billboard 200.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Something in the Orange" was a No.1 country hit.
                    It rose to No. 10 on the Billboard Hot 100
                </p>

                <p>
                    “Something in the Orange” explores the emotional aftermath of a
                    relationship that is clearly ending, even as the narrator struggles
                    to accept it. While the song opens with reassurance and warmth,
                    that comfort slowly gives way to uncertainty and longing.
                </p>

                    <p>
                        “Everyone thinks it was over some deep, dark thing, and it was just
                        me in a cabin in Wisconsin. I thought about the word ‘orange’ and I
                        was watching the sunset and I was like, ‘Oh, that’s a cool story to
                        tell in a song.’”
